## Description
In the capstone project for the **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate**, I analyzed publicly available Fitbit daily activity and sleep data to identify key trends, relationships, and behavioral patterns pertinent to **Bellabeat**--a health and fitness technology company that develops smart wellness products for women. 
Utilizing these insights, I explored how they could be applied to Bellabeat's **Leaf** product--a wellness tracker than can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip--to better understand user behavior and inform data-driven product and marketing strategies.
